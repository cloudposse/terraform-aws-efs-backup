# terraform-aws-efs-backup [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-efs-backup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-efs-backup) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-efs-backup.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-efs-backup/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module designed to easily backup EFS filesystems to S3 using DataPipeline.

The workflow is simple:

* Periodically launch resource (EC2 instance) based on schedule
* Execute the shell command defined in the activity on the instance
* Sync data from Production EFS to S3 Bucket by using `aws-cli`
* The execution log of the activity is stored in `S3`
* Publish the success or failure of the activity to an `SNS` topic
* Automatically rotate the backups using `S3 lifecycle rule`

## Usage

Include this module in your existing terraform code:

```hcl
module "efs_backup" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-efs-backup.git?ref=master"

  name                               = "${var.name}"
  stage                              = "${var.stage}"
  namespace                          = "${var.namespace}"
  vpc_id                             = "${var.vpc_id}"
  efs_mount_target_id                = "${var.efs_mount_target_id}"
  use_ip_address                     = "false"
  noncurrent_version_expiration_days = "${var.noncurrent_version_expiration_days}"
  ssh_key_pair                       = "${var.ssh_key_pair}"
  datapipeline_config                = "${var.datapipeline_config}"
  modify_security_group              = "true"
}

output "efs_backup_security_group" {
  value = "${module.efs_backup.security_group_id}"
}
```
## Integration with `EFS`

To enable connectivity between the `DataPipeline` instances and the `EFS`, use one of the following methods to configure Security Groups:

1. Explicitly add the `DataPipeline` SG (the output of this module `security_group_id`) to the list of the `ingress` rules of the `EFS` SG. For example:

```hcl
module "elastic_beanstalk_environment" {
  source     = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-elastic-beanstalk-environment.git?ref=master"
  namespace  = "${var.namespace}"
  name       = "${var.name}"
  stage      = "${var.stage}"
  delimiter  = "${var.delimiter}"
  attributes = ["${compact(concat(var.attributes, list("eb-env")))}"]
  tags       = "${var.tags}"

  # ..............................
}

module "efs" {
  source     = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-efs.git?ref=tmaster"
  namespace  = "${var.namespace}"
  name       = "${var.name}"
  stage      = "${var.stage}"
  delimiter  = "${var.delimiter}"
  attributes = ["${compact(concat(var.attributes, list("efs")))}"]
  tags       = "${var.tags}"

  # Allow EB/EC2 instances and DataPipeline instances to connect to the EFS
  security_groups = ["${module.elastic_beanstalk_environment.security_group_id}", "${module.efs_backup.security_group_id}"]
}

module "efs_backup" {
  source     = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-efs-backup.git?ref=master"
  name       = "${var.name}"
  stage      = "${var.stage}"
  namespace  = "${var.namespace}"
  delimiter  = "${var.delimiter}"
  attributes = ["${compact(concat(var.attributes, list("efs-backup")))}"]
  tags       = "${var.tags}"
  
  # Important to set it to `false` since we added the `DataPipeline` SG (output of the `efs_backup` module) to the `security_groups` of the `efs` module
  # See NOTE below for more information
  modify_security_group = "false"

  # ..............................
}
```

2. Set `modify_security_group` attribute to `true` so the module will modify the `EFS` SG to allow the `DataPipeline` to connect to the `EFS`

**NOTE:** Do not mix these two methods together. 
`Terraform` does not support using a Security Group with in-line rules in conjunction with any Security Group Rule resources.
https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/security_group_rule.html
> NOTE on Security Groups and Security Group Rules: Terraform currently provides both a standalone Security Group Rule resource 
(a single ingress or egress rule), and a Security Group resource with ingress and egress rules defined in-line. 
At this time you cannot use a Security Group with in-line rules in conjunction with any Security Group Rule resources. 
Doing so will cause a conflict of rule settings and will overwrite rules.
